### Goals for the year

As I mentioned on the homepage I have set a goal of reading 52 books
this year, averaging out to a book a week. I currently behind the pace
I should be at to reach the goal, but I have still made some decent 
progress. Here are some of the titles I've read so far:

 - Animal Farm by George Orwell
 - Million Dollar Weekend by Noah Kagan
 - effortless by Greg McKeown

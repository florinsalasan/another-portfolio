## Some ramblings

### Book read

As I mentioned on the homepage I have set a goal of reading 52 books
this year, averaging out to a book a week. I currently behind the pace
I should be at to reach the goal, but I have still made some decent 
progress. Here are some of the titles I've read so far:

 - Animal Farm by George Orwell
 - Million Dollar Weekend by Noah Kagan
 - effortless by Greg McKeown
 - Ultralearning by Scott Young

### Reflections

There are some other books that I have not listed but a common thread of advice
I have noticed from the various 'self help' and 'personal improvement' books is
just start. This advice goes in the face of the majority of the way I have 
learned up to this point. In high school and university it was always theory
first followed by attempting to apply it, rather than running into a wall 
repeatedly when trying to accomplish a task and then being introduced to the
theory that helps you solve it. Admittedly I think this method of learning
is applied far more easily to software development rather than topics like math
but Ultralearning attempts to make the case for all subjects.

### Applications to my personal life

In any case I am trying to apply this to some of the topics I want to learn 
more about. The first area I'm trying to learn by doing rather than by theory
is improving my programming ability. The first step I've taken into this approach
is by having at least one daily github contribution. I have not missed a day from
November 16 2023, to the date of writing. This hasn't always been actual code
being pushed but in most cases it has been. My main thinking behind this is 
doing my best to escape the so called 'tutorial hell' where the only projects
one starts and ends are those that have step by step tutorials rather than
through the ability to mix and match the knowledge I have to make new things
that I want to do.

## Chip8 Interpretter

### The Tech Stack
This emulator was written fully in C and used the SDL2 framework for the graphics library,
it was then compiled with CMake using a guide I found online.

I wanted to use C again since I hadn't used it in a long time, instead opting to use higher level
languages like python and javascript instead. So I wanted to see if I still knew how to write C effectively.
After finishing up this Chip8 interpretter I still don't know how good my C is since I avoided using
pointers, not intentionally, but because I never ran into a scenario where I believed that it would 
have been necessary to use them. Looking back this may have created issues since tests from various
test ROMs all pass but the interpretter is still buggy and not working properly on certain games.

# Write up still in progress

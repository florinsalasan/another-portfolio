## My Personal Portfolio Site

### The Tech Stack

I wanted to keep the tech stack simple and relevant to modern technologies, so as much
as the primeagen praised HTMX and go, I decided to instead follow Theo's advice and go 
with the t3 stack, using:

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

I decided against implementing authentication or having a database since I didn't really
think it was necessary for a portfolio website. Looking back maybe a database could have
been useful, instead of using json for some data to populate project cards.

Working with Tailwind felt a bit strange at first, since up until now I had always written
custom CSS, but after learning about how it helps build dynamic layouts and focuses on 
mobile first I saw how useful the approach was. In the past I've tried desktop first and 
then trying to make it work for mobile and it was almost always a mess, so I really appreciated
Tailwind for this, however I don't know if I'll ever get used to how verbose the jsx can become
for more complex components.

### Features of the Site

I began by looking through the sites showcased on <a href="https://create.t3.gg/en/t3-collection">t3.gg></a>
[t3.gg](https://create.t3.gg/en/t3-collection)
and found [Josh's personal site](https://imjosh.dev) to use as a starting point.
I really liked the way he styled the site and it had a blog section which I wanted my
site to have too. From there I made a few changes of my own.

Firstly I created a Projects section where all projects I want to showcase are housed in 
some cards that provide a quick summary of the project. I also added a filtering system
based on blog tags but it's been pretty useless since I haven't written enough posts
for it to matter. I also added a scroll to top of page button in the shape of the CN Tower
on desktop and a regular overlaid arrow on mobile.

### Next Steps

I want to refactor the filtering system to work with the projects section too since it might 
actually be useful for that section. Besides that I want to improve the page you're reading
this on to create a better details page for the projects, maybe add in an image carousel 
for each project to better showcase some of the features, or maybe instead have images 
throughout the write up, haven't really decided. And of course, write more blog posts so that
the tag filters could have actually been worth writing.

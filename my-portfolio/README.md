## TODO:

- [x] Add a project section on the landing page that showcases other projects hosted on github, added separate page instead
- [x] Add a way to sort the blog posts by tags, this is overkill at this point in time
- [ ] Begin writing blog posts, attempt to automate some of the metadata like the posted date
- [x] Add a button to go to top of page to replace the CNTower link for mobile views
- [x] Add indicator for which filters are active, add reset filter button
- [ ] Modify dropdown component to work with both .md files and .json files for use on blog and project sections
- [x] Add event listener for system/browser dark mode change and use preference on load
- [x] Move ToTopBtn and CNTower to the layout instead of on individual pages since they're everywhere anyways

- [ ] Will add others as the scope expands
